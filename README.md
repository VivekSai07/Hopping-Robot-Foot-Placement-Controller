# Foot-Placement Controller of Hopping Robot (Raibert Controller)

## Description
This MATLAB project implements a Foot Placement Controller for a Hopping Robot using the Raibert Controller. The Raibert Controller is a widely recognized and influential method for achieving dynamic legged locomotion in robots. In this project, we focus on developing a robust and efficient controller to govern the foot placement of a hopping robot.

## Features
- Raibert Controller: The core of the project is the implementation of the Raibert Controller, a pioneering control algorithm for legged robots.
- Hopping Robot Simulation: A comprehensive simulation environment for the hopping robot, providing insights into its dynamic behavior and control response.
- Foot Placement Precision: Emphasis on achieving accurate foot placement through advanced control strategies.
- MATLAB Implementation: The entire project is implemented using MATLAB, making it accessible and easy to understand for researchers and enthusiasts.


## Usage
1. Clone the Repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/VivekSai07/Hopping-Robot-Foot-Placement-Controller.git
```

2. Navigate to the Project Folder:
```bash
cd Hopping-Robot-Foot-Placement-Controller
```

3. Run the Main Script:
```bash
run RaibertHopper.m
```
This will initiate the simulation and visualize the hopping robot controlled by the Raibert Controller.
